## Findings So Far

ðŸ”¶ `react-native` styling is unit-less. This will limit capabilities for spacing and layout of web designs.

ðŸŸ¥ `react-native-web` handles mapping `react-native` components into HTML DOM elements. However most of the time this appears to only output `div`s. This is antithetical to HTML semantics. We can claw back some semantics thanks to [react-native-web | Semantic HTML](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/accessibility/#semantic-html), however this is very limited. There are over 150 different HTML elements but `react-native-web` supports mapping to only about 20 of them: [GitHub | propsToAccessibilityComponent](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/blob/e8a0cbc60af40bdac6505704ffe34764267cd77f/packages/react-native-web/src/modules/AccessibilityUtil/propsToAccessibilityComponent.js#L12). It is unlikely for this to ever improve, since cross-compatibility requires that any given component within `react-native` must have a way to render on all platforms. For example there is no `react-native` `table` component, because there is no sensible render target for mobile apps.
